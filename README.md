## XXX

**SpringpotFit: XXX** is a Matlab package that implements a framework for tuning fractional-order controllers. The package leverages the Cross-Entropy (CE) method for global search optimization and employs an augmented Lagrangian formulation to handle equality and inequality constraints. With some straightforward adaptations, the FracTune strategy can also be applied to other types of modern controllers.

**SpringpotFit** uses as optimization tool the package **CEopt - Cross-Entropy Optimizer**, which can be downloaded at <a href="https://ceopt.org" target="_blank">https://ceopt.org</a>.

### Overview
**SpringpotFit** was developed to calibrate fractional-order rheological models with time-dependent order using the cross-entropy method. Such a model is suitable for describe the complex mechanical behavior of polymers. The underlying results are reported in the following publication:
More details are in the following paper:
- *J. G. Telles Ribeiro and A. Cunha Jr, Advanced creep modeling of polypropylene: A variable-order fractional calculus approach, 2024 (under review)*

### Features
- Implements Cross-Entropy method for fractional-control tuning
- Handles equality and inequality constraints using augmented Lagrangian method
- Transparent "gray-box" optimizer with intuitive control parameters
- Robust and scalable for moderately sized complex problems
- Demonstrated applicability through select case studies

### Usage
To get started with **FracTune**, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/americocunhajr/FracTune.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the code directory:
   ```bash
   cd FracTune/FracTune-1.0
   ```
3. To optimize a structure, execute the main file corresponding to your case:
   ```bash
   Main_XXX
   ```

This package includes the following files:
* Main_XXX.m  -- xxx
