## XXX

**SpringpotFit: XXX** is a Matlab package that implements a framework for tuning fractional-order controllers. The package leverages the Cross-Entropy (CE) method for global search optimization and employs an augmented Lagrangian formulation to handle equality and inequality constraints. With some straightforward adaptations, the FracTune strategy can also be applied to other types of modern controllers.

**SpringpotFit** uses as optimization tool the package **CEopt - Cross-Entropy Optimizer**, which can be downloaded at <a href="https://ceopt.org" target="_blank">https://ceopt.org</a>.

### Overview
**SpringpotFit** was developed to tune fractional-order controllers for dynamical systems by solving nonconvex optimization problems via the cross-entropy method. The underlying results are reported in the following publication:
More details are in the following paper:
